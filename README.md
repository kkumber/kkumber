### 🧑‍💻 Who I Am
Hi, I'm **Angel**, a 4th-year IT student who believes in building apps that *actually do something*.  
Currently obsessed with turning boring PDFs into something fun (like quizzes, flashcards, or... ✨magic?).

- 💡 Final year capstone? Built **[Aralith](https://github.com/your-username/aralith)** — an AI-powered quiz engine that turns lesson files into study tools.
- 🧰 Tools I wield: Laravel ⚙️ Inertia ⚡ React 🌐 PostgreSQL 🐘
- ☕ Fuel: Black coffee, good UI, and occasional imposter syndrome.

### 🚀 Current Mission: Build Useful Things
> “If it doesn’t make someone’s life easier, it’s probably not worth shipping.”

That’s why I built:
- **Aralith** – Upload a lesson (PDF, DOCX, video, etc.) → get AI-powered quizzes, flashcards, summaries, and even Google Forms.  
- **AidBot** – AI chatbot for student queries. 3rd place 🥉 in a hackathon built in less than 24 hours. Sleep? Who’s she?
